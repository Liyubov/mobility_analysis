analysis of mobility patterns of humans from various data sources and models

# analysis of global mobility data
Here we analyze two datasets: 

a. global mobility data (air planes) 
Open mobility data (accessed June 2019)
https://bluehub.jrc.ec.europa.eu/migration/app/index.html?state=5cc845a97758cd17cdecd1fb


b. human mobility data from Erasmus network of student exchanges, 

which is a subnetwork of the first one since most of the time 
people are taking flights while travelling. 

The questions we consider here are:

1. Since in both cases we do not have the data about people who are travelling, 
we cannot fully analyze the human mobility
(human locations data openhumans can be the data!!! )

2. At the same time we can consider people to be represented by 
random walk dynamics.
Then the random walk can be considered as an underlying model for 
dynamics on network of flights connections.
For random walk discovering networks see seminal work Modern Graph Theory | Bela Bollobas | Springer

3. We reformulate the question from global transport mobility 

“What is the probability of a human being travelling a certain distance in a short period of time?” 
To more specific:
"How some specific people are travelling?"
This is related to random walk motion on percolated networks.
